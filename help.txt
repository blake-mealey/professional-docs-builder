NAME
    compile.py

SYNOPSIS
    compile.py --help
    compile.py command0 [command1, ...] [options]

DESCRIPTION
    Handles the downloading of JSON data files from a private GitHub repo, the generation of .tex files
    from the data files, the compilation of the resulting TeX document using LuaLaTeX, and the managing
    and uploading of the resulting PDF documents. Every variable option defaults to the value of the
    same key in config.json. For example, if the --engine option is not included, then the program will
    use the 'engine' entry in the dictionary stored in config.json.
